PSO algorithm (particle swarm optimization), using Python 2.7.

OBJECTIVE: Minimization of an objective function through PSO.

ALGORITHMS implemented:

1 - SPSO (Standard Particle Swarm Optimizer)
2 - PSO-WL (Linear Time Varying inercia Weight Particle Swarm Optimizer)
3 - PSO-WL-CL (Linear Time-Varying Inercia Weight with Time-Varying Acceleration Coefficients Particle Swarm Optimizer)
4 - PSO-WR (Random Time Varying Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimizer)
5 - PSO-WA (Adaptive Time-Varying Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimizer)
6 - HPSO (Self-Organizing Particle Swarm Optimizer)
7 - HPSO-CL (Linear Time-Varying Acceleration Coefficients Self-Organizing
Particle Swarm Optimizer)

*It's is possible to use the constriction factor method (CFM).

RESTRICTION:
Only box restrictions are implemented.

GRAPH:
1 - graphs of performance.
2 - graph of objective function.

MOVIE FRAMES:
1 - creation of frames for each iteration
